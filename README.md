The telecom churn prediction model is designed to identify customers who are likely to leave a telecom service provider. Implemented in Python, this model leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and predict churn. Key features include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and identifying important features influencing churn.
Model Selection: Evaluating various algorithms such as Logistic Regression to find the best performing model.
Model Training: Training the chosen model on historical data to learn patterns and relationships.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC score.
Prediction and Interpretation**: Making churn predictions on new data and providing actionable insights to reduce churn rates.
The model is robust and scalable, providing telecom companies with valuable insights to retain customers and improve overall service satisfaction.
At last I deployed this model on an AWS EC2 instance using Flask
